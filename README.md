# rpm-package-function

Functionality to create an RPM package repository in Azure Blob Storage with
an Azure Function App to keep it up to date.

This project does not currently include a dnf plugin to add an `Authorization: Bearer` token
to requests to the repositories - one is in progress.

# Getting Started

## Required tools

- `poetry` and `poetry-plugin-export`: required for running the creation commands and exporting dependencies to requirements.txt format.
  - Poetry installation instructions are available at https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
  - Once poetry is installed, run
    ```bash
    poetry self add poetry-plugin-export
    ```
    to install `poetry-plugin-export`.
- Azure CLI
  - Installation instructions available at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli

- Docker
  - Installation instructions available at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

## Basic usage

To create a new RPM package repository with an Azure Function App, run

```bash
poetry run create-resources <resource_group_name>
```

with the name of the desired resource group. The scripting will autogenerate a
package repository name for you - `rpmrepo` followed by a unique string to
differentiate it across Azure.

If you wish to control the suffix used, you can pass the `--suffix` parameter:

```bash
poetry run create-resources --suffix <suffix> <resource_group_name>
```
which will attempt to create a storage container named `rpmrepo<suffix>`.

By default all resources are created in the `eastus` location - this can be
overridden by passing the `--location` parameter:

```bash
poetry run create-resources --location uksouth <resource_group_name>
```

## Installing the `dnf` plugin and downloading packages

To install packages from your new repository:

### For distribution repositories

- Create a repository file `/etc/yum.repos.d/<storage account name>.repo` with the following content
  for each distribution you want to support:

  ```ini
  [<storage account name>{distribution}]
  name=<storage account name>{distribution}
  baseurl={base url given by create-resources}/{distribution-letters}/{distribution-numbers}/
  enabled=1
  gpgcheck=0
  skip_if_unavailable=1
  ```

  For example, to support a distribution `el8` in storage account `rpmrepodemo`
  the repository file might look like:

  ```ini
  [rpmrepodemoel8]
  name=rpmrepodemoel8
  baseurl=https://rpmrepodemo.blob.core.windows.net/packages/el/8/
  enabled=1
  gpgcheck=0
  skip_if_unavailable=1
  ```

  and a distribution 'fc34' would look like:

  ```ini
  [rpmrepodemofc34]
  name=rpmrepodemofc34
  baseurl=https://rpmrepodemo.blob.core.windows.net/packages/fc/34/
  enabled=1
  gpgcheck=0
  skip_if_unavailable=1
  ```

  Multiple repository definitions can exist in the same file.

### For flat repositories

- Create a repository file `/etc/yum.repos.d/<storage account name>.repo` with the following content:

  ```ini
  [<storage account name>]
  name=<storage account name>
  baseurl={base url given by create-resources}/
  enabled=1
  gpgcheck=0
  skip_if_unavailable=1
  ```

### For all repository types

- Install `dnf-plugin-azure-auth`.
  - This plugin is currently in progress - watch this space!

- Create an authentication token in the environment with the name `AZURE_STORAGE_TOKEN_<storage account uppercased>` (e.g. `AZURE_STORAGE_TOKEN_RPMREPODEMO`)

  export `AZURE_STORAGE_TOKEN_<storage account uppercased>`=$(az account get-access-token --query accessToken --output tsv --resource https://storage.azure.com)

  You must have 'Storage Blob Data Reader' access to the storage account.
- Now, use yum/dnf as normal!

  ```shell
  $ dnf list | grep rpmrepo
  Using Azure authentication for rpmrepodemocm2
  demo.x86_64                                                    1.0.0-1.cm2                    rpmrepodemocm2
  ```

# Design

The function app works as follows:

- It is triggered whenever an `.rpm` file is uploaded to the monitored blob
  storage container in the configured upload directory.
    - It is triggered by an Event Grid trigger.
- The packages are organised by distribution.
    - This is determined by the `release` of the package - the expected format
      for this is
      `<version number>.<distribution>[.<minor bump>]`
    - The distribution is expected to be a series of letters followed by a series
      of numbers
    - Any packages without a distribution are moved to the `rejected` folder.
    - Any packages that have the same name as an existing package remain in
      the upload directory.
- It then iterates over all `.rpm` files and looks for a matching `.package` file.
- If that file does not exist, it is created
    - The `.rpm` file is downloaded and repository metadata is generated using
      `createrepo_c`.
    - The metadata is bundled into the `.package` file.
- All `.package` files within a distribution are iterated over, downloaded, and
  combined into a single set of repository metadata using `mergerepo_c`.

## Speed of repository update

The function app triggers at the speed of an Event Grid trigger running in Consumption
mode; in the worst case this means triggering from a Cold Start. In practice
the repository is updated within 1 minute.
